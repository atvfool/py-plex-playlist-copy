# XML files pulled from Plex for a playlist (url like: http://[IPADDR]:[PORT]/playlists/[PlaylistID]/items)

Python script gets the size (in GB) for a plex playlist and a copies those files.

I take some of movies to places with no internet and poor cellular reception on an external drive and use a raspberry pi hooked up to a projector to watch. This script makes it easier to copy the movies from playlists created in plex
