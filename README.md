# py-ps-plex-playlist-copy
# XML files pulled from Plex for a playlist (url like: http://[IPADDR]:[PORT]/playlists/[PlaylistID]/items)

Python script that creates a powershell script to get the size (in GB) for a plex play list and a separate script that copies those files to the current directory. Needed to create something that work quickly with SMB hence the powershell side of it, would like to improve it to be solely python.
